# game-of-life

This is not a game in its usual meaning. The human player’s input just creates the initial state of the “universe.” After that, the game is completely deterministic, and one just observes the evolution of life forms, migration, and even socialization of primitive organisms.
The Game of Life was described by John Conway in 1970. It came from a mathematical problem, and since 1970 it has attracted the interest of scientists in various fields: physics, biology, economics, and so on.
The most amazing feature of this game is its simplicity, leading to many more complex patterns.
Who knows, maybe this game touches something fundamental in this world?
